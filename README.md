# MTFBWU

Personal **body-and-training tracker** — nutrition, workouts, rehab, hydration, meditation, measurements, private progress photos, calendar, profile, and custom trackers.

Not a journal. Not a social app. **Odiina is a separate product.**  
This software does **not** provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice.

## Current increment

**Increment 7 — Rehab engine** (implemented locally; commit when ready)

- Curated rehab catalog + clinician-guided plans/phases/days/prescriptions
- Restrictions with original wording + optional structured fields
- Performed sessions with pain/swelling/instability/confidence + alerts
- Dexie v6 offline rehab drafts + ordered outbox replay
- Real Rehab board card + focus runner; workout restriction notice only
- ADRs 0009–0010; RLS test `increment7_rehab_rls.sql`

Still deferred: diagnosis/AI rehab, pose/wearables, measurements/photos, clinician portal.

Planning sequence: `docs/architecture/BUILD_INCREMENTS.md`.
Increment notes: `docs/development/INCREMENT_7_REHAB_ENGINE.md`.
Data model: `docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md`.
